Restaurant Reviews
Create an app where a user can upload a description of a restaurant and then other users can rate it by submitting a form.

A restaurant should include:

name
specialty (italian, mexican, etc.)
address
an estimate of how expensive it is (this could be from one to five dollar signs, or just a string such as "cheap", "moderate", "expensive".
When a user rates it, they should enter a value from 1 to 5 stars and the amount of time that they had to wait for their food.

As a user, I want to see a list of all the available restaurant names.
When I click on a restaurant I want to see the other details about it.
I would like to see only the restaurants of a particular specialty.
As a user, I want to be able to edit a restaurant record.
As a user, I want to see the average wait time for each restaurant and the average rating.
